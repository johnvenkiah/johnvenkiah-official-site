          “The notes played, sometimes flow like a summer rain over the keys.
          Now there is a greater weight and power in John's attack; Venkiah
          challenges the piano. The result is a bigger expression, it becomes
          more.” - Bengt Eriksson, Lira Music magazine about the new album
          Elevation 2017

          “John Venkiah is one of the most talented jazz musicians I have come

        John Venkiah was born in 1986 in London. He started to play the keyboard
        at 5 years of age, and moved to Sweden in 1998. Playing mostly by ear,
        John listened to records his mother played for him, and learnt a lot by
        just hearing and playing.

        As he grew into his teens, both singing and playing became a bigger part
        of his life. John began writing his own music at the age of 14,
        experimenting with different influences, including soul, Motown and
        jazz. He began studying music at high school, where he met fellow
        musicians and started his first bands.

        John took his Bachelor's degree in jazz piano at the Malmö Academy of
        Music in 2012, where he met and learned from renown Swedish pianist Jan
        Lundgren, who, apart from teaching him lots of fundamental things within
        jazz piano, helped him to move forward within the genre in many aspects.
        These including John Venkiah Trio's appearances at Ystad Sweden Jazz
        Festival, the recording of their debut album Things Change (2014,
        Volenza), not to mention continuous inspiration and coaching.

        “A firm grip on tradition, fresh, personal ideas, a brilliant technique,
        delicate touch, developed sense for harmonies and a phrasing with true
        authority - in John Venkiah we have a richly and thoroughly equipped
        young jazz pianist” - Sven Bjerstedt, 5/5, Ystad Allehanda, 3rd August
        2014
